My partner is Ayah Zaareer.

Ayah Zaareer's repository, This was a nice project; I don't understand variable names as in the constructor at app in this.state (output1, output2), but the rest of the code is simple to understand; I read spaghetti code, and Ayah Zaareer's code follows the rules; to better, modify variable names, and break app.js into tiny components.
